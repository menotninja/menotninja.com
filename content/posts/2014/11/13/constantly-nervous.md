Summary: Dealing with the imposter syndrome.

Two years ago, I started my first internship at a startup in Silicon Valley as
a software engineer. This was the first time I wrote production code that was
affecting real customers. Like many of you here, my mind was flooded with
self-doubt and fear. I felt that I wasn’t good enough, and was very nervous
about everything I wrote. It had to be perfect; it had to stand up to the
scrutiny of the other "real" engineers.

My first few months were rewarding, but also excruciating. I was endlessly
obsessing over my work and worrying about tiny, inconsequential details. Each
day, I worried that I would be discovered and fired because I wasn’t good
enough.

In other words, I had the Imposter Syndrome. It drove me crazy.

A few days ago, I suddenly realized that I no longer feel that way anymore.
Certainly, I cared about the quality of my work, but I am no longer obsessed,
crazy, about minute details and afraid of criticism. Looking back, I credit
this change to one mindset shift: I compared myself to myself, instead of
watching the success of others.

I made it a habit to review code that I wrote two weeks ago and identify areas
where I can improve. I collected a list of things to learn, articles to read,
and set time aside to study these every day. While I was not following any
specific metrics, I was tracking my productivity, code quality, and kept an eye
on number of production issues to monitor my progress.

Each day was a small success. I stopped comparing my day-to-day reality with
the highlight reel of the rockstars in the industry. I
watched/shadowed/pestered other engineers in the company, and made sure that I
was getting better each day.

I stopped comparing my beginning to other’s prime.

You are supposed to cringe at code you wrote many months ago. If you don’t,
you are not growing. Now go out there and code your ass off.
