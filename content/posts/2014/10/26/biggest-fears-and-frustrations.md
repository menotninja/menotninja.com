Summary: What were your biggest hopes, dreams, and fears?

What were your biggest fears and frustrations when you started programming?

I posted the [question] on [/r/learnprogramming] today, and received several
interesting responses. Many beginners complained about being overwhelmed,

> I think the sheer amount of information can be a bit overwhelming. It's
> difficult to try to learn something and then realize that you should've
> learned something else first. - ampersandlin

and confused,

> I'd start learning X, then came across Y and jumped ship and started learning
> Y. Rinse and repeat. After 6 months I had touched many technologies but
> didn't understand anything. - goralph

A few were worried about posting to forums such as reddit and stackoverflow:

> You think reddit is bad when you have a typo they will lose there mind. Ask
> something simple they rip your head off but the reason you asked was because
> you didn't know a key term and therefor couldn't search properly. - samjk14

Do any of these resonate with you? Were your fears completely different? Let me
know in the comments.
