Summary: Managing feedback and embracing constructive criticism.

**You built something. Now put it out there, feel the excitement, and don't
hide inside the closet.**

Criticism can be stinging. It can make you feel incompetent, "not good
enough," or that you are "not moving fast enough." However, it is necessary
- the discomfort you feel is often a sign of growth. Constructive feedback is
one of the biggest learning accelerators, and the time you spent learning how
to receive it will be rewarded many times over.

Find that discomfort. If you are comfortable all the time, that is a sure sign
that you have reached a plateau and stopped advancing. Learn to stretch in that
discomfort, and be smug in the knowledge that it is a symptom of you pushing
your boundaries.

### Asking for Feedback

If you expect to be overwhelmed by the response, do some preparation work
before asking for feedback.

Identify a small number (say, 3) areas of weakness, and ask for feedback
specifically for these areas. If you receive feedback for other areas, welcome
them, but don't let yourself be overwhelmed. You can work on them, _later_.
Focus your attention and energies on a few select areas.

### Using Criticism

Whenever you expect a wide audience, also expect a mixture of high quality and
low quality feedback.

Separate constructive from non-constructive feedback. Look for clear signals,
such as

- the haters, who criticize using adjectives on the "overall" work without
  pointing out specific flaws _e.g._ "you cannot make this better, stop trying."
- the supporters, who point out specific flaws and tell you what specific
  actions to take to make it better _e.g._ "here is one way to make it better."

Pro Tip - don't stress out about specific flaws in one work/project. Instead,
focus on identifying patterns and habits that you can improve for all future
works _e.g._ better ways to write unit tests. Generalize and reuse.

Thoughts, comments, criticism? Fire away.
