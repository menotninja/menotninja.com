        <h3><a class="post-title" href="/how-to-actually-mentor-somone.html">How to (Actually) Mentor Someone</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><p><strong>Too many of us have no idea how to be a good mentor.</strong></p>
<p>When you started your career, you probably had a few mentors help you out along
the way. Some mentors were phenomenal, most were mediocre, and a few were
terrible. Eventually, as your career advanced, you (being ambitious and
diligent) began to accumulate valuable skills and experience. Soon, you realize
that more people come to you for help, and slowly but surely, you find yourself
taking up a mentorship role at your company.</p>
<p>Yet, most mentors have no idea what they are doing. Some make you feel stupid.
Some feel like they can’t wait to show off. Some leave their students more
lost and confused than before.</p>
<p>Here are some strategies that I have learnt over the past year. Some might
surprise you.</p>
<h3>Never Say, "It's Easy!"</h3>
<p>Because it makes them feel stupid. "Yea, if it’s so easy, why do I need
you?" Instead, focus on being understanding and building rapport. You were
there once; use that similarity to establish a connection.</p>
<h3>Go Slow, and Think Aloud</h3>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are great. Your vim skills are amazing. When you are in the
zone, your flash between tmux tabs constantly. Don’t do it when you are
mentoring.</p>
<p>Go slow. Explain what you are doing, and <em>why you are doing it</em>. Describe your
intuitions, your gut feelings. Most important, explain how you know when it’s
time to Google, and how you came up with the search terms.</p>
<h3>It’s OK to Drive</h3>
<p>… if you drive slowly. If a problem is complex, it’s OK to take over the
keyboard and help with debugging. It’s less stressful for the student, and
it’s easier for you to think aloud and explain what you are doing. Show them
your mental processes.</p>
<p><em>At the end of the day, mentorship is not really about transferring technical
knowledge. It’s about helping them gain the confidence to go forth and explore
the big, scary, and sometimes overwhelming wilderness of software development.</em></p>
<p>Thoughts, comments, criticism? Fire away.</p></p>
