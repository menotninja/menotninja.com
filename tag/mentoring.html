        <h3><a class="post-title" href="/the-joy-of-planning.html">The Joy of Planning</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><h3>Fighting the Kraken</h3>
<p>A long long time ago, the assignments and tasks I worked on were incredibly
simple. I could bang out a half-assed solution with my eyes closed, submit it
with minimal tests, and still get a decent score. Of course this inflated my
confidence, and I never bothered learning how to plan. Yeah, I was that
arrogant guy in your CS class.</p>
<p>"Ah! Looks trivial. Just give me a day and I will figure it out."</p>
<p>Heh. What an idiot I was.</p>
<p>If you have worked on any significant project, you know that this attitude
wouldn’t serve me well. I was young and naïve; as projects got harder, I
thought that I could increase productivity by using some shiny framework, some
fancy automation tool, a particular brand of mechanical keyboards, or even a
<em>different keyboard layout</em>. Of course that didnt work. What was I thinking?</p>
<p>A few years after I started learning how to code, I worked on a distributed
system with a partner (let’s call him Ted.) We were both hot blooded and
wanted to jump straight to the code and bang it out as fast as we could,
because we thought we were "ninjas". LOL. We had a great time, and were
consistently coming up with new ideas every day and wanted to add "cool"
features to our project.</p>
<p>"Oh! Wouldn’t it be cool if it did this?"</p>
<p>We worked feverishly, and kept adding more and more features to the project.
"Because we can! Haha!" The codebase grew uncontrollably, and work became
harder and harder to coordinate. It grew rapidly out of control, and complexity
skyrocketed. It was a mess. It was the worst spaghetti code, ever. On top of
that, the large number of features we had to support made it difficult to use
and very tricky to debug.</p>
<p>Eventually, it became to much for us to handle. We spent several weeks
obsessively refactoring the code and organized various pieces into separate
components. We barely made the deadline, and fell short of our expectations.</p>
<p>It sucked, but it was a good lesson for us.</p>
<h3>Drawing a Map, Writing the Story</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/3985841869/in/photostream/"><img alt="planning" src="/images/sf-bay.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I didn’t glean the lesson entirely until a few years later; I realized that
the root cause was our lack of discipline to plan ahead.</p>
<p>When you start working on a large project, it can often be exciting and
overwhelming at the same time. Where do I start? What features should I build?
Occasionally, you might be tempted to jump straight in and soak it up (which
was what we did.) Instead, break it down into smaller pieces. Whittle away at
the problem until it becomes tractable.</p>
<p>Ha! I can already hear some of you yelling: "I am AGILE! Who needs a plan?
<em>rolls eyes</em>" Sorry to have to burst your bubble, but it is a myth that agile
software development and planning are <a href="http://dilbert.com/strip/2007-11-26">mutually exclusive ideas</a>.
Agile doesn’t mean “no plan required” - it means that you plan to collect
feedback at the end of each iteration to update the plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Practical design does not anticipate what will happen to your application; it
merely accepts that something will and that, in the present, you cannot know
what. - Sandi Metz, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096BYG7C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0096BYG7C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=menoni-20&amp;linkId=GJF7PZQN4QWHP3ZV">Practical Object-Oriented Design In Ruby</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start with a short plan. It doesn’t have to be very involved, but it should
give you a map showing you where to go, and how to get started.</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the purpose of the project. If possible, identify existing
   solutions and abstractions (e.g. It’  a "distributed cache" or "REST
   server").</li>
<li>Make a list of desired features, organizing them into 'must have', and 'nice
   to have'. Decide what you are definitely <em>not</em> building.</li>
<li>Figure out the components and their interfaces. Create a story - what
   features belong together naturally?</li>
<li>Identify important libraries and dependencies. Say, you need JSON parsers: pick one.</li>
<li>(Advanced) Make a list of assumptions. For example, you might assume that
   the your processes have complete ownership of the disk (or other devices) in
   other to make some optimizations.</li>
<li>(Advanced) Pick <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=menoni-20&amp;linkId=YD6RIFH4Y2C6AAPW">design patterns</a> you intend to use. Decide if
   you wish to use a dependency injection framework.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the kicker: this plan is not final. In fact, it’s likely to change as
the project grows, but it makes every change visible and forces you to think
about that change.</p>
<p>Creating a short plan (like the one above) makes it easier to</p>
<ul>
<li>split up the work,</li>
<li>identify difficult components that require more research, and</li>
<li>design the components so that they are easy to test/change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now get out there and code your ass off.</p></p>

        <h3><a class="post-title" href="/habit-to-write-better-code.html">One Habit to Start Writing Better Code</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><p><strong>Don't just "will" yourself to write better code. Cultivate keystone habits
and improve your craft.</strong></p>
<p>CS undergraduates and beginners often ask: how can I write better code? It is
hard to provide a definitive answer; after all, issuing instructions to the CPU
is a science, but writing good code is an art. Numerous books have been written
providing thousands of pages of guidelines advocating good practices. However,
how should one get started?</p>
<p>While it might be useful to keep a checklist of guidelines and review them
every time you program, it can get tedious real fast. Nobody wants to do that.
Instead, it can be much more productive to focus on creating habits that will
follow you throughout your career. Here is a keystone habit that will set you
on your way.</p>
<h3>Write Test Stubs In Parallel</h3>
<p>As you create a new classes/modules/methods, also create test stubs in a
separate window. It's similar to TDD, but it is way easier to get started. All
you have to do is to create the test suites, and give your test cases
meaningful names, but you don’t have to fill them in. Add TODO comments in the
test cases if you like.</p>
<p><img alt="test-stubs" src="/images/test-stubs-small.png" /></p>
<p>It is a simple habit that does a few tricks. Since it reminds you that your
code needs to be testable, it encourages you to</p>
<ul>
<li>have a plan/design before you code;</li>
<li>break up (or organize) your code into smaller bite-size chunks; and</li>
<li>manage dependencies on the network or on external libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give it a shot.</p></p>

        <h3><a class="post-title" href="/asking-for-feedback-and-criticism.html">Asking for Feedback and Criticism</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><p><strong>You built something. Now put it out there, feel the excitement, and don't
hide inside the closet.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="ci-branches" src="/images/wall.jpg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want
something.
<cite>- Randy Pausch</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Criticism can be stinging. It can make you feel incompetent, "not good
enough," or that you are "not moving fast enough." However, it is necessary
- the discomfort you feel is often a sign of growth. Constructive feedback is
one of the biggest learning accelerators, and the time you spent learning how
to receive it will be rewarded many times over.</p>
<p>Find that discomfort. If you are comfortable all the time, that is a sure sign
that you have reached a plateau and stopped advancing. Learn to stretch in that
discomfort, and be smug in the knowledge that it is a symptom of you pushing
your boundaries.</p>
<h3>Asking for Feedback</h3>
<p>If you expect to be overwhelmed by the response, do some preparation work
before asking for feedback.</p>
<p>Identify a small number (say, 3) areas of weakness, and ask for feedback
specifically for these areas. If you receive feedback for other areas, welcome
them, but don't let yourself be overwhelmed. You can work on them, <em>later</em>.
Focus your attention and energies on a few select areas.</p>
<h3>Using Criticism</h3>
<p>Whenever you expect a wide audience, also expect a mixture of high quality and
low quality feedback.</p>
<p>Separate constructive from non-constructive feedback. Look for clear signals,
such as</p>
<ul>
<li>the haters, who criticize using adjectives on the "overall" work without
  pointing out specific flaws <em>e.g.</em> "you cannot make this better, stop trying."</li>
<li>the supporters, who point out specific flaws and tell you what specific
  actions to take to make it better <em>e.g.</em> "here is one way to make it better."</li>
</ul>
<p>Pro Tip - don't stress out about specific flaws in one work/project. Instead,
focus on identifying patterns and habits that you can improve for all future
works <em>e.g.</em> better ways to write unit tests. Generalize and reuse.</p>
<p>Thoughts, comments, criticism? Fire away.</p></p>

            <p class="post-meta"><p><img alt="mentoring" src="/images/mentor-small.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Too many of us have no idea how to be a good mentor.</strong></p>
<p>When you started your career, you probably had a few mentors help you out along
the way. Some mentors were phenomenal, most were mediocre, and a few were
terrible. Eventually, as your career advanced, you (being ambitious and
diligent) began to accumulate valuable skills and experience. Soon, you realize
that more people come to you for help, and slowly but surely, you find yourself
taking up a mentorship role at your company.</p>
<p>Yet, most mentors have no idea what they are doing. Some make you feel stupid.
Some feel like they can’t wait to show off. Some leave their students more
lost and confused than before.</p>
<p>Here are some strategies that I have learnt over the past year. Some might
surprise you.</p>
<h3>Never Say, "It's Easy!"</h3>
<p>Because it makes them feel stupid. "Yea, if it’s so easy, why do I need
you?" Instead, focus on being understanding and building rapport. You were
there once; use that similarity to establish a connection.</p>
<h3>Go Slow, and Think Aloud</h3>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are great. Your vim skills are amazing. When you are in the
zone, your flash between tmux tabs constantly. Don’t do it when you are
mentoring.</p>
<p>Go slow. Explain what you are doing, and <em>why you are doing it</em>. Describe your
intuitions, your gut feelings. Most important, explain how you know when it’s
time to Google, and how you came up with the search terms.</p>
<h3>It’s OK to Drive</h3>
<p>… if you drive slowly. If a problem is complex, it’s OK to take over the
keyboard and help with debugging. It’s less stressful for the student, and
it’s easier for you to think aloud and explain what you are doing. Show them
your mental processes.</p>
<p><em>At the end of the day, mentorship is not really about transferring technical
knowledge. It’s about helping them gain the confidence to go forth and explore
the big, scary, and sometimes overwhelming wilderness of software development.</em></p>
<p>Thoughts, comments, criticism? <a href="/how-to-actually-mentor-somone.html">Fire away</a>.</p></p>
