            <p class="post-meta"><p><strong>You built something. Now put it out there, feel the excitement, and don't
hide inside the closet.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="ci-branches" src="/images/wall.jpg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want
something.
<cite>- Randy Pausch</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Criticism can be stinging. It can make you feel incompetent, "not good
enough," or that you are "not moving fast enough." However, it is necessary
- the discomfort you feel is often a sign of growth. Constructive feedback is
one of the biggest learning accelerators, and the time you spent learning how
to receive it will be rewarded many times over.</p>
<p>Find that discomfort. If you are comfortable all the time, that is a sure sign
that you have reached a plateau and stopped advancing. Learn to stretch in that
discomfort, and be smug in the knowledge that it is a symptom of you pushing
your boundaries.</p>
<h3>Asking for Feedback</h3>
<p>If you expect to be overwhelmed by the response, do some preparation work
before asking for feedback.</p>
<p>Identify a small number (say, 3) areas of weakness, and ask for feedback
specifically for these areas. If you receive feedback for other areas, welcome
them, but don't let yourself be overwhelmed. You can work on them, <em>later</em>.
Focus your attention and energies on a few select areas.</p>
<h3>Using Criticism</h3>
<p>Whenever you expect a wide audience, also expect a mixture of high quality and
low quality feedback.</p>
<p>Separate constructive from non-constructive feedback. Look for clear signals,
such as</p>
<ul>
<li>the haters, who criticize using adjectives on the "overall" work without
  pointing out specific flaws <em>e.g.</em> "you cannot make this better, stop trying."</li>
<li>the supporters, who point out specific flaws and tell you what specific
  actions to take to make it better <em>e.g.</em> "here is one way to make it better."</li>
</ul>
<p>Pro Tip - don't stress out about specific flaws in one work/project. Instead,
focus on identifying patterns and habits that you can improve for all future
works <em>e.g.</em> better ways to write unit tests. Generalize and reuse.</p>
<p>Thoughts, comments, criticism? Fire away.</p></p>

            <p class="post-meta"><p><img alt="mentoring" src="/images/mentor-small.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Too many of us have no idea how to be a good mentor.</strong></p>
<p>When you started your career, you probably had a few mentors help you out along
the way. Some mentors were phenomenal, most were mediocre, and a few were
terrible. Eventually, as your career advanced, you (being ambitious and
diligent) began to accumulate valuable skills and experience. Soon, you realize
that more people come to you for help, and slowly but surely, you find yourself
taking up a mentorship role at your company.</p>
<p>Yet, most mentors have no idea what they are doing. Some make you feel stupid.
Some feel like they can’t wait to show off. Some leave their students more
lost and confused than before.</p>
<p>Here are some strategies that I have learnt over the past year. Some might
surprise you.</p>
<h3>Never Say, "It's Easy!"</h3>
<p>Because it makes them feel stupid. "Yea, if it’s so easy, why do I need
you?" Instead, focus on being understanding and building rapport. You were
there once; use that similarity to establish a connection.</p>
<h3>Go Slow, and Think Aloud</h3>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are great. Your vim skills are amazing. When you are in the
zone, your flash between tmux tabs constantly. Don’t do it when you are
mentoring.</p>
<p>Go slow. Explain what you are doing, and <em>why you are doing it</em>. Describe your
intuitions, your gut feelings. Most important, explain how you know when it’s
time to Google, and how you came up with the search terms.</p>
<h3>It’s OK to Drive</h3>
<p>… if you drive slowly. If a problem is complex, it’s OK to take over the
keyboard and help with debugging. It’s less stressful for the student, and
it’s easier for you to think aloud and explain what you are doing. Show them
your mental processes.</p>
<p><em>At the end of the day, mentorship is not really about transferring technical
knowledge. It’s about helping them gain the confidence to go forth and explore
the big, scary, and sometimes overwhelming wilderness of software development.</em></p>
