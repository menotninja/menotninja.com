        <h3><a class="post-title" href="/habit-to-write-better-code.html">One Habit to Start Writing Better Code</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><p><strong>Don't just "will" yourself to write better code. Cultivate keystone habits
and improve your craft.</strong></p>
<p>CS undergraduates and beginners often ask: how can I write better code? It is
hard to provide a definitive answer; after all, issuing instructions to the CPU
is a science, but writing good code is an art. Numerous books have been written
providing thousands of pages of guidelines advocating good practices. However,
how should one get started?</p>
<p>While it might be useful to keep a checklist of guidelines and review them
every time you program, it can get tedious real fast. Nobody wants to do that.
Instead, it can be much more productive to focus on creating habits that will
follow you throughout your career. Here is a keystone habit that will set you
on your way.</p>
<h3>Write Test Stubs In Parallel</h3>
<p>As you create a new classes/modules/methods, also create test stubs in a
separate window. It's similar to TDD, but it is way easier to get started. All
you have to do is to create the test suites, and give your test cases
meaningful names, but you don’t have to fill them in. Add TODO comments in the
test cases if you like.</p>
<p><img alt="test-stubs" src="/images/test-stubs-small.png" /></p>
<p>It is a simple habit that does a few tricks. Since it reminds you that your
code needs to be testable, it encourages you to</p>
<ul>
<li>have a plan/design before you code;</li>
<li>break up (or organize) your code into smaller bite-size chunks; and</li>
<li>manage dependencies on the network or on external libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give it a shot.</p></p>

        <h3><a class="post-title" href="/asking-for-feedback-and-criticism.html">Asking for Feedback and Criticism</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><p><strong>You built something. Now put it out there, feel the excitement, and don't
hide inside the closet.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="ci-branches" src="/images/wall.jpg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want
something.
<cite>- Randy Pausch</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Criticism can be stinging. It can make you feel incompetent, "not good
enough," or that you are "not moving fast enough." However, it is necessary
- the discomfort you feel is often a sign of growth. Constructive feedback is
one of the biggest learning accelerators, and the time you spent learning how
to receive it will be rewarded many times over.</p>
<p>Find that discomfort. If you are comfortable all the time, that is a sure sign
that you have reached a plateau and stopped advancing. Learn to stretch in that
discomfort, and be smug in the knowledge that it is a symptom of you pushing
your boundaries.</p>
<h3>Asking for Feedback</h3>
<p>If you expect to be overwhelmed by the response, do some preparation work
before asking for feedback.</p>
<p>Identify a small number (say, 3) areas of weakness, and ask for feedback
specifically for these areas. If you receive feedback for other areas, welcome
them, but don't let yourself be overwhelmed. You can work on them, <em>later</em>.
Focus your attention and energies on a few select areas.</p>
<h3>Using Criticism</h3>
<p>Whenever you expect a wide audience, also expect a mixture of high quality and
low quality feedback.</p>
<p>Separate constructive from non-constructive feedback. Look for clear signals,
such as</p>
<ul>
<li>the haters, who criticize using adjectives on the "overall" work without
  pointing out specific flaws <em>e.g.</em> "you cannot make this better, stop trying."</li>
<li>the supporters, who point out specific flaws and tell you what specific
  actions to take to make it better <em>e.g.</em> "here is one way to make it better."</li>
</ul>
<p>Pro Tip - don't stress out about specific flaws in one work/project. Instead,
focus on identifying patterns and habits that you can improve for all future
works <em>e.g.</em> better ways to write unit tests. Generalize and reuse.</p>
<p>Thoughts, comments, criticism? Fire away.</p></p>

        <h3><a class="post-title" href="/constantly-nervous.html">A Note to Those Constantly Nervous/Worried About Their Code</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><p>Two years ago, I started my first internship at a startup in Silicon Valley as
a software engineer. This was the first time I wrote production code that was
affecting real customers. Like many of you here, my mind was flooded with
self-doubt and fear. I felt that I wasn’t good enough, and was very nervous
about everything I wrote. It had to be perfect; it had to stand up to the
scrutiny of the other "real" engineers.</p>
<p>My first few months were rewarding, but also excruciating. I was endlessly
obsessing over my work and worrying about tiny, inconsequential details. Each
day, I worried that I would be discovered and fired because I wasn’t good
enough.</p>
<p>In other words, I had the Imposter Syndrome. It drove me crazy.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I suddenly realized that I no longer feel that way anymore.
Certainly, I cared about the quality of my work, but I am no longer obsessed,
crazy, about minute details and afraid of criticism. Looking back, I credit
this change to one mindset shift: I compared myself to myself, instead of
watching the success of others.</p>
<p>I made it a habit to review code that I wrote two weeks ago and identify areas
where I can improve. I collected a list of things to learn, articles to read,
and set time aside to study these every day. While I was not following any
specific metrics, I was tracking my productivity, code quality, and kept an eye
on number of production issues to monitor my progress.</p>
<p>Each day was a small success. I stopped comparing my day-to-day reality with
the highlight reel of the rockstars in the industry. I
watched/shadowed/pestered other engineers in the company, and made sure that I
was getting better each day.</p>
<p>I stopped comparing my beginning to other’s prime.</p>
<p>You are supposed to cringe at code you wrote many months ago. If you don’t,
you are not growing. Now go out there and code your ass off.</p></p>

        <h3><a class="post-title" href="/the-art-of-googling.html">The Art of Googling: Hunting Down Solutions in Record Time</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><p><strong>Few beginners know how to use Google effectively.</strong></p>
<p>Everyone knows that one should use Google; yet few beginners know how to use
Google effectively. Even fewer mentors recognize this as an important skill
that needs to be taught explicitly.</p>
<p>When you point your browser at google.com, you find a blank search box staring
back at you. What magical keywords should you type in there to help you solve
the problem you are tackling?</p>
<h3>First, imagine what you want to see in the search results.</h3>
<p>If you are trying to debug an exception/error/unexpected behavior, odds are
someone else encountered the same problem. The first goal is to find a similar
question on StackOverflow, a thread on a mailing list etc. A subsequent goal
might be to learn more about a specific cause by looking up documentation for
some API or function.</p>
<p>Keeping these goals in mind, imagine what keywords are most likely to appear on
these pages.</p>
<h3>Cut down the search space.</h3>
<p>Your search terms should be sufficient to uniquely describe the issue you are
tackling. Include names of languages, frameworks, libraries etc. In some
situations, it might be necessary to include version numbers as well; this is
more important in languages like Scala (2.9 ~ 2.11), Python (2.7 vs 3), and
Java (6 ~ 8).</p>
<p>Add and remove keywords until you get a satisfactory list of results, and use
what you learn to fine tune your search. It frequently takes me 3~4 tries to
get what I want.</p>
<h3>Selectively copy errors.</h3>
<p>Copying the entire stack trace will not be useful - it will contain too many
details that are specific to your work. On the other extreme, searching for
“it doesn’t work” will not help you either. Find the sweet spot in the
middle, including just enough pertinent information to identify key aspects of
the error.</p>
<p>This is an art. In Java, I usually copy just the exception class and the
accompanying exception message.</p>
<p>We all cross a hump at some point. Eventually, you will become so familiar with
the space of problems that you know, instinctively, what to look for.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-title" href="/feeling-overwhelmed.html">Feeling Overwhelmed, and Dealing With It</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><p>The first time I learnt a programming language, I was astounded. I was
following exercises in a textbook, and I felt like I could do anything. I was
spending hours sorting out weird bugs and memorizing C++’s weird syntax.
However, as soon as I finished the book and began venturing out on the Web to
learn more on my own, I was <em>overwhelmed</em>.</p>
<p>There was so much to learn! Over the next few years, I learnt a new language
every few months, yet it still felt like I wasn’t learning fast enough and
"couldn't keep up with the competition." In every discussion I enter, every
hackathon I attend, people around me were talking about new
languages/frameworks/technologies/libraries. I felt like an impostor most of
the time, and I told myself I "wasn’t good enough."</p>
<p>And then I figured it out. I learnt how to deal with this feeling of
helplessness, build my skills, gain confidence, and carve out a career for
myself. It took me a long time, but I devised a good system for taking charge
of my learning and growth.</p>
<p>Here are two tricks you can start using today.</p>
<h3>Keep A Pile of "Things to Read"</h3>
<p>Trust me, it sounds lame, but keeping a list helps to keep the burden off your
mind and help you feel less overwhelmed. As you encounter questions or new
terms, resist the urge to tackle them immediately. Instead, write them down,
and finish what you were working on. Review this list weekly and reorganize it
from time to time, then begin working items off this list once you get a
chance.</p>
<p>Anything (including Notepad, or vim) will work, but I personally use pocket and
OmniFocus.</p>
<p>It is especially gratifying to review your list at the end of each year and see
how far you have come. You may not be as good as the people you idolize, but
you will know that you are better than you were last year.</p>
<h3>Pick a Few, and Focus. Become an Expert.</h3>
<p>Sometimes it feels like there are a lot of technologies, languages, and
frameworks out there. It’s impossible to learn them all. So what do we do?</p>
<p>We look to the data.</p>
<p>You can use trends from indeed.com and StackOverflow to get a feel of the most
popular or up-and-coming tools in the industry today and guess what will
continue to be useful in 1 to 4 years. Pick a few and focus on them until you
become an expert.</p>
<p>One more thing - believe it or not, you are an <em>engineer</em>, not just a
<em>programmer</em>. Every language is just a tool in your toolbox. Also, most skills
(such as logical thinking, debugging, and object-oriented programming) are
transferable.  Don’t worry about spending too much time on Ruby and not playing
with Python.  The knowledge you gain about interpreted languages are more
valuable than your familiarity with the syntax.</p></p>

        <h3><a class="post-title" href="/read-debug-a-new-lang.html">How to Read/Debug a New Language Quickly</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><p>When I was starting out, I frequently felt overwhelmed by the never-ending (and
growing) list of languages and frameworks. I was constantly worrying about
whether I was (or wasn’t) spending enough time on the right languages, or
whether I was missing out on any opportunities because I didn’t know
COOL-NEW-SHINY-EVEN-DOES-YOUR-DISHES LANGUAGE X or
BEAUTIFULLY-HANDCRAFTED-BY-YOUR-GRANDMA FRAMEWORK Y. It was a constant source
of stress and contention - I was obsessed, paralyzed, and lost in FOMO-land.</p>
<p>I am not the only one; we have all been there. An article about the problem
recently appeared on TechCrunch, labeling the phenomenon as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/18/you-too-may-be-a-victim-of-developaralysis/">Developer
Paralysis</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years, I realized that I am no longer worried anymore. Through months
of trial-and-error and observation, I have figured out a strategy for learning
how to read and debug code written in new languages quickly. This gave me the
much-needed confidence to take on different projects and tackle new challenges.
When it comes to picking up a new language, most folks will tell you to jump
straight in, and "use it in a project." Don’t get me wrong - this is a
perfectly reasonable tactic, and I strongly recommend it for learning your
first language. However, for your subsequent languages, this tactic also
guarantees that you will repeat the same agony and confusion every time. When I
tried it, I found myself resisting changes to my mental models, and then
quickly getting lost and being inundated by the large number of blog posts,
articles, and documentation about the shiny new language. <em>Diving in is fun,
but inefficient.</em> Most top performers I know use a more structured approach to
introduce themselves to a new language systematically.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong> Ask some basic questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it imperative or functional? Does it have objects and classes?</li>
<li>Is it interpreted or compiled?</li>
<li>How do you organize code into smaller chunks? Does it have namespaces?</li>
<li>How do you use libraries?</li>
<li>Find the documentation for the language API and bookmark it.</li>
<li>Follow the documentation to setup your environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t try to do too much on the first day. Use your motivation to focus on
getting yourself ready, and stop at "Hello World".</p>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong> Learn how to create a tight feedback loop. Nothing accelerates your
learning like being able to test ideas quickly and get feedback. Use it to try
out the syntax, rewrite tiny methods/functions etc.</p>
<p>In general, I prefer REPL over unit tests over actual program execution. If
possible, find a debugger and use it to set breakpoints and inspect variables.
Leave the advanced debugger features to later.</p>
<p>Note that at this point, we haven’t written much code yet, just spending time
getting ready.</p>
<p><strong>Days 3 to 7</strong> Create tiny examples for each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializing String/Lists/Arrays</li>
<li>Writing Loops + Binary Search</li>
<li>Using Serialization + File I/O</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the tools you found in Days 1 and 2 to debug and build these quickly.
Tighten the feedback loop if you have to.</p>
<p><strong>Days 8 to 15</strong> Create tiny examples for each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse String/List/Array</li>
<li>Implement Your favorite OOP pattern e.g. The Strategy Pattern</li>
<li>Implement Your favorite Dynamic Programming solution e.g. The Knapsack Problem</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to be an expert at every language you learn. This strategy
prepares you by deliberately acquiring the information you need to get most of
the way there.</p>
<p>Now go out there and code your ass off.</p></p>

            <p class="post-meta"><p>What were your biggest fears and frustrations when you started programming?</p>
<p>I posted the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2kc5hp/what_arewere_your_biggest_fears_and_frustrations/">question</a> on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a> today, and received several
interesting responses. Many beginners complained about being overwhelmed,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the sheer amount of information can be a bit overwhelming. It's
difficult to try to learn something and then realize that you should've
learned something else first. - ampersandlin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and confused,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd start learning X, then came across Y and jumped ship and started learning
Y. Rinse and repeat. After 6 months I had touched many technologies but
didn't understand anything. - goralph</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few were worried about posting to forums such as reddit and stackoverflow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You think reddit is bad when you have a typo they will lose there mind. Ask
something simple they rip your head off but the reason you asked was because
you didn't know a key term and therefor couldn't search properly. - samjk14</p>
