            <p>Two years ago, I started my first internship at a startup in Silicon Valley as
a software engineer. This was the first time I wrote production code that was
affecting real customers. Like many of you here, my mind was flooded with
self-doubt and fear. I felt that I wasn’t good enough, and was very nervous
about everything I wrote. It had to be perfect; it had to stand up to the
scrutiny of the other "real" engineers.</p>
<p>My first few months were rewarding, but also excruciating. I was endlessly
obsessing over my work and worrying about tiny, inconsequential details. Each
day, I worried that I would be discovered and fired because I wasn’t good
enough.</p>
<p>In other words, I had the Imposter Syndrome. It drove me crazy.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I suddenly realized that I no longer feel that way anymore.
Certainly, I cared about the quality of my work, but I am no longer obsessed,
crazy, about minute details and afraid of criticism. Looking back, I credit
this change to one mindset shift: I compared myself to myself, instead of
watching the success of others.</p>
<p>I made it a habit to review code that I wrote two weeks ago and identify areas
where I can improve. I collected a list of things to learn, articles to read,
and set time aside to study these every day. While I was not following any
specific metrics, I was tracking my productivity, code quality, and kept an eye
on number of production issues to monitor my progress.</p>
<p>Each day was a small success. I stopped comparing my day-to-day reality with
the highlight reel of the rockstars in the industry. I
watched/shadowed/pestered other engineers in the company, and made sure that I
was getting better each day.</p>
<p>I stopped comparing my beginning to other’s prime.</p>
<p>You are supposed to cringe at code you wrote many months ago. If you don’t,
you are not growing. Now go out there and code your ass off.</p>
